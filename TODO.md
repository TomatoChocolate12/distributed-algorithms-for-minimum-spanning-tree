# Things to do

Two frameworks, MPC and MPI. We basically have preferably 3, at least 2 algorithms per framework.

Then, we compare each of the algorithms within each framework, and produce plots and stuff.

## MPC Linear Time

- Graph Sketching (the one in the slides)
- 
- 

## MPI framework

- GHS algorithm
- GKP algorithm
- Distributed Prim's algorithm

Maybe, we can also run a non-distributed Prim's or Kruskal's and compare with the non-distributed case to show how the distributed version performs better.
